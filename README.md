# Sources Appendix

## About The Project
This project is the first phase of a 3-phase strategic programme that my AFK is running to explore areas for expansion of their employment (and related) services. This first phase focuses on London (Greater London Boroughs/inside the M25). Phase 2 will look at the rest of the UK and Phase 3 will look at what is happening in the rest of the world to see what organisations are undertaking internationally. 
The project was executed by trainee associates from Xander Talent. (https://www.xandertalent.com/).
