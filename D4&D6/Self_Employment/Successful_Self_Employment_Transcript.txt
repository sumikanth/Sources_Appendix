all right good afternoon and welcome to
the respectability webinar for
tuesday october 13th um and
for those of you who work in disability
employment happy national disability
employment awareness month
um obviously 2020 is a year like no
other and
um this is going to be an ending like no
other as we are all gathering in virtual
events
um but because we're gathering in
virtual events we can all share
um you know the insights and ideas from
across the country
and i think that you know we are all
leveraging technology to drive
accessibility to drive inclusion um
to in in response to the events of this
year so far
um i think this is particularly
important because let's be honest
it's been a hard year for a lot of
people especially workers with
disabilities who may have lost their
jobs
um or young people who are just getting
out of school and maybe
transitioning into the workplace for the
first time and that's why
i think that there's a really a huge
opportunity for all of us who care about
employment for people with disabilities
to think creatively
think outside of the box maybe even live
outside the box
and i think one of the biggest most
interesting you know ways forward as we
get people back to work or get people
into work for the first time
is the idea of self-employment or
entrepreneurship for people with
disabilities
so that's what we're here to talk about
today iowa vocational rehabilitation
services has some really interesting
models some really great work that
they're doing
um i will let them kind of detail all of
the really incredible things that
they're working on
and so for our audience you know please
meet the folks from iowa vr we'll be
walking you through
they'll be walking you through their
programs their priorities
but i want to quickly run through a
little context and then introduce you to
them
so
um obviously disability is a huge issue
at one as
best estimate available there's roughly
around 61 million people with
disabilities
living in the united states today um put
another way that's around one in four
adults
um it's ability as far as respectability
is concerned covers the entire spectrum
of issues from physical issues to
sensory cognitive
especially mental health issues mental
health has become a particularly
important issue because so many people
are facing social isolation due to the
quarantines
are facing disruptions in their personal
lives due to everything that's going on
from the pandemic to the
employment situations so our the
disability community continues to grow
um there are all different categories of
disabilities there's temporary versus
permanent
visible disabilities such as you know
amputees wheelchair users
um actually also later this this month
is also spina bifida awareness month
that's
obviously a category of visible
disabilities but there are millions more
people who have non-visible disabilities
learning disabilities many people in the
autism spectrum
and disabilities can happen from before
you're born to when you're born
to be acquired later in life um and that
is so important and
you know as we disability advocates
always talk about
we are one of the the largest minority
community in the country
which also means we share critical
issues across issues of race ethnicity
gender but it's also the only this the
only minority community that anyone can
join
at any time and that's really important
because you know everyone is
you know one accident illness or a
couple years of aging
away from being a person with a
disability and identifying as such
um and so we have here gathered for you
a really incredible team from iowa
vocational rehabilitation services
they have really are some of the biggest
thought leaders around disability
employment and voc rehab
today iowa has consistently had some
best employment outcomes of any state vr
program
um but and it's not just because they're
successful they're really innovative and
that's what i want to talk about today
we've got david mitchell who has been
the administrator for several years i've
had the pleasure of knowing him
all throughout the work that
respectability has done around the
workforce innovation and opportunity act
um we've got coachelle um who
helps run the iowa self-employment team
she's going to be talking about their
business work
um we've got linda we've got steve
and several others from the iowa team
joining us today and so
um they are the experts and i
am going to go quiet and run the slide
deck so
david the floor is yours
well phillip thank you so much the iowa
vocational rehabilitation team is really
excited to be
presenting on the topic today and we
really feel that it's
critically important in meeting the
employment needs of our job candidates
with the most significant disabilities
and the way we do that
is surrounds this whole topic of
self-employment and entrepreneurship as
we try to look at some innovative
strategies to meet the needs of our
job candidates the the work of our
business team really stands out
uh let me first share that vocational
rehabilitation is part of our
state federal national system
and we are celebrating a hundred years
of existence as a
federal vr program and as philip said
this year has been especially
interesting with everything going on
not only is it a hundred years of the vr
program
but 30 years of our celebration with the
americans with disabilities act
in iowa we are the general vr agency
we also have our partner organization
with the iowa department for the blind
and they work with individuals with
visual impairments
so our program works with all the other
disability types that
philip had shown on us on a slide we
have a unique partnership with our
department for the blind folks and we
share
a memorandum of agreement where we
partner together both with financial
assistance
and technical assistance allowing them
to utilize the expertise of coachelle
and the team that you're going to hear a
little bit more about today
vr is an individualized program
and there's nowhere is that even more
important
in terms of individual services in our
entrepreneurship program
so we run the gamut of individuals that
partner with our small business
development centers
with our banks they have formal
well thought out business plans to the
more
creative you know sketch on the back of
your napkin
some ideas that we can integrate into an
employment plan
and that really address can we bring in
more money for that entrepreneur
than they're expending there's really a
common belief
that regardless of those programs that
employment
and work is good it really provides a
value
for an individual's quality of life and
if you look at any of the health
determinate
surveys out there there's a real
consensus
that the purpose of work is valuable for
all of us
and that it really helps meet the needs
and interests and functional abilities
of our job candidates so we believe that
if we can find some ways to help them
look at that quality through
self-employment that we're really going
to be more successful
with vocational rehabilitation a lot of
you will have heard the terms
customized employment and supported
employment
those are really pretty common
strategies for
employment services for people with
disabilities and
part of how we're moving forward with
self-employment
is really integrating customized and
supported employment features
into our entrepreneurship program you're
going to learn a little bit more about
that as we go forward
so be listening for the basics that are
common to sound business planning
that make common sense but also be
listening
for ways that we're creatively meeting
the needs of our customers
and a belief that everybody can work
with the right services and the right
supports
certainly we've been challenged in
today's environment and we've been
impacted by covid
and virtual service delivery but we're
still finding ways
to deliver services to meet the needs of
our job candidates
and you're going to hear about some of
those stories i want to thank again
phillip and the team from respectability
for all the work that's occurring in
advocacy
and education and referral to continue
to push employment systems
to meet the needs of all of our workers
and i'm especially excited
for you to know a little bit more about
our iowa vr staff
and our entrepreneurial team i'm not
going to introduce them i'll let them
kind of introduce themselves as they get
on here one by one
and you'll get a chance to hear from
each of them um
so one of our employment staff is out
ill today
uh so we're kind of substituting a
little bit but let me get this started
by introducing you to our bureau
chief um steve faulkner steve's in
charge
of our field services bureau and one of
his special assignments
is working with our iowa self-employment
team so steve i'm going to turn it over
to you
well thank you can you hear me yes we
can
all right um yeah my name is steve
faulkner and i'm
chief of the of our field services
operations here we have 13 area offices
here in the state of iowa we cover all
99 counties
and as you know we're a small state we
only have about 3 million people here
in the state of iowa some of you all may
have towns that are that big
but the bottom line of it is we have
maybe upwards of 12 000 individuals in
the state
who really are active vocational
rehabilitation clients right now and
that's not counting the
iowa department for the blind and then
there's an additional 23 000
individuals in the state who are a high
school age and they have disability
related barriers and we consider those
potentially eligible and we do provide
services to them as well in the high
school setting pre-employment transition
services
and at some point or another we may very
well take many and most of them
on into active client roles so we have
we have quite a client base to operate
we have two business development
specialists
uh we have kachel and dennis they
actually split the state in half
and what we have here is a partnership
between our business development
specialists
and our field counselors and our field
staff the field staff are made up of
rehabilitation counselors
who have a master's degree in counseling
and
who can actually be our first line
working with individuals
through a program of counseling and
guidance to help provide
informed choice opportunities for
individuals to explore
whatever kind of employment that they're
looking for so it might be competitive
integrated employment where they're
working for somebody else
or it might be self-employment or
supported self-employment
where they're essentially working for
themselves
but knowing how to put that all together
it's a partnership between our business
development specialists and those field
counselors
now at the end of the day what we're
really after
is a business plan
that is feasible and that will result
in a situation where the individual is
earning um the amount that's going to be
necessary for their own individual needs
and expectations
based on their abilities and their
talents and
just the motivation that they have to
move forward in a in a business plan
so we don't have a set amount that we're
looking for the individual trying to
earn
um at one point in time we we wanted to
have them be a certain percentage of sga
but i really think at this point in time
we're looking to have every one of our
programs to be
individually tailored that follows that
employment
first philosophy that david was talking
about that we believe that everybody can
work
with the right supports and that that's
true for self-employment
and that's true for working for someone
else i'm not trying to say that
self-employment's right for everybody
but through that counseling and guidance
process we hope
that the counselors can work with our
job candidates
that we call our clients our job
candidates to help them make the
decision that's going to work best for
them
and so we don't have any pre-prescribed
vision of what that's going to look like
we're really going to have to
tailor-make each and every one of these
programs whether it's
community employment or whether it's
self-employment we're going to
tailor-make those programs
where we have our self-employment
program involved
at the end of the day we want a business
that's going to be self-sustaining
and by that i mean it's a business that
will continue to run
after we've left uh left off providing
support
uh we've we've provided the maybe
informed
choice options the resources the
supports
uh perhaps that might be job readiness
training or
perhaps that might be uh assistive aids
and devices or prosthetic devices or
financial literacy training or maybe uh
we'll hear more about benefits planning
and we can provide that as well
we probably could go to the third slide
i think i've thoroughly covered the
first one
but then back again to that partnership
that we have out in the field
we we don't just dump a business
candidate onto the business development
specialist and tell them to go make a
business
and make it happen the counselor has to
stay involved
and the reason for that is because
they're going to be issues that come up
along the way
where the individual is going to maybe
need uh
need to take a step back maybe look at a
job readiness issue or maybe get a piece
of a
assistive technology or some kind of an
accommodation that we weren't counting
on or
or a special training of some kind or
maybe they look at the process and it
just isn't working out maybe we've got
to take a step back and
and maybe we've got a transportation or
a housing issue that we need to really
address
so the counselor has to stay involved
but the business
development specialist is there to help
them win their way through that process
of exploring the market to see if there
is a market for what they have to sell
our individuals that want to go into
small business they got to have some
kind of a service
or a product that they can sell many of
them are not going to have the money to
put into the program
many of them are not going to have maybe
the experience in business to write a
business plan
and so we try to provide through our
counselors and through our assistant
linda and to our business development
specialist we try to provide
options for those folks to meet them
where they're at
and help them develop the plan that's
going to best meet their needs
but again at the end of the day the
business development specialist will
help them
to really look at what that market is
and how can they
test feasibility and how can they
determine whether or not they can make
this go and how much would they have to
earn in order to cover their costs and
put together a plan of some kind
that again will result in something it
may be small
it may be big some of our businesses are
are
are really netting a lot of money some
of them are very small
and we expect them to grow and it may
take a while for them to grow
if they're going to need additional
supports in order to be able to do the
business like the supported
self-employment concept and you'll see
examples of these we have to figure into
the business plan what that's going to
look like how are we going to pay for
those supports
what that what's that going to be are we
going to have some kind of funding from
medicaid or are we going to factor it
into the business plan itself and
actually
hire people within the business to help
take care of that that process
so there's many things that go into this
it's really very much a
a process that's that's collaborative in
nature
and we do involve outside resources the
small business development centers the
workforce development centers
our area high schools and uh even our
community colleges so
i think with that i'm going to turn it
over to coachelle and she's going to get
you into the nuts and bolts of this a
little bit more
good afternoon um so when we look at
employment and self-employment
um options if we could go to the next
slide
we look at different things and
sometimes
our clients don't have the typical model
of an entrepreneur
so we get creative with our work we look
at the skills that they have
their optimum optimal vocational goals
that we want them to be able to achieve
with our assistance
and the basic job functions of each
vocational goal that they talk to us
about
and then we work as a team to put things
together
so that they have natural supports and
community
supports beyond where we have so they
have a team behind
them and the supports that they need
that allows them to get that long-term
vocational goal achieved at their
individual basis
those are coming from their needs
and supports the community supports
really are
assisting outside of our realm
we have counselors part of that team job
coaches
and business specialists like myself
involved
in planning the planning phase
really does give us a good look at where
we're going to have to implement
other people into the business
to help that candidate one of the first
employment goals that we have
is what does the candidate or client
want to do and then we go back to what
can they do in order to be vocationally
employed
and then we look at what other supports
those supports again job coach
long-term natural supports
and then ongoing business supports
either from the community
or someone like myself so those are how
we go about that
in the process in the next slide
because i'm going to carry it through we
have a business
called jt fire starters and the video
will kind of explain and then i'll pick
up after the video but this will explain
all the work that's involved in helping
an entrepreneur
with limited success rates
um of artistic background
and he found something he loved and he
wanted to do it
and this is how not only ibrs and isd
program
iowa self-employment program helped him
but his natural supports and community
if we could play that
hi i'm catherine toops and i am daniel
tupes's mom
daniel is 23 years old has autism and
obsessive-compulsive disorder even
though he has a disability
he has a job he is the owner of jt
fire starters
[Music]
the business started in 2015 at that
time daniel was still in high school
he followed a schedule but he needed a
lot more prompts
he needed a lot more redirection to stay
on task and to finish
the activities but now that it's 2019
he's much more independent he follows
the routine of what he needs to do on a
daily basis
he is able to make the product pretty
much independently
he still has his job coach there to help
him and assist
but through the transition years daniel
has
grown tremendously he is much more
independent he's much more focused
he knows what to expect he likes going
to work he knows the routine
it's predictable and that's what he
thrives on
he knows when it's monday tuesday
wednesday thursday and friday
and he knows when it's saturday because
he doesn't want to get up
but when it is a work day and he's not
able to go to work because of a snow
storm
he does get upset he wants to work so
that's why we're very proud of daniel
for his independence and his ability to
continue to work
[Music]
the interesting thing about jt
firestarters is that they're all made
with recyclable materials
we use an egg carton shredded paper
dryer limbs and candle wax
we're very proud to partner with the
community the community has helped us
start something good
people in the community and businesses
safe supplies for us
we receive shredded paper candles in any
shape or form
and cardboard egg cartons that we then
reuse to make jt firestarters
[Music]
we have a slogan start something good
and that's our
personal philosophy we want to start
something good in the community
as well as in daniel's life in daniel's
life it's very important that he works
he wants to go to work and he can be a
productive
member of society he enjoys working and
we're very proud of daniel
[Music]
hi
that gives us a great overview of jt
fire starters but not
only that it gives us a great overview
of how to think outside that box
how to fit within the realms of the end
of individuals
capabilities of working and the need and
the desire
to work for their own personal success
the gt fire starters is not a typical
story
it is one that again his mother
catherine who you got the
joy of hearing speak is really been his
biggest advocate i met daniel and his
mother
his high school team back in 2014 we
started planning
2015 he started this business
outside of high school and he has
progressed
in january of 2021 he's projected to
hire another individual
and he does stay on task currently he's
selling jt fire starters
in nine states but the biggest advocate
is a dubuque iowa
family-owned store called tysons who
have gone and built bigger and better
stores throughout the midwest
primarily wisconsin iowa minnesota
and they've touched a little bit in
illinois
but in those stores every single tysons
has been a huge advocate for jt fire
starters
in making sure that they can get to
other campgrounds
other non-profits that sell
along with a huge campground in kentucky
that reached out because they found
jt firestarters on facebook that is
success
success story with jt fire starters
now we are going to get into a little
bit of how we come up to these ideas
in the next few slides and the basics of
what we follow as business
specialist what our um support person
linda helps us with in making sure that
we do
our jobs better every day
for our clients linda
hi my name is linda and so next slide
all right so this is the process of our
program and these are specific steps
that
our team goes through with the candidate
so the steps that we cover is pretty
much orientation
initial planning benefits planning
benefits planning and feasibility
financial and technical assistance
civilizations of the business and
follow-up
so we're going into more description of
these steps in the next few slides so
during orientation we are exploring
if self-employment is the right choice
so we can go on to the next slide
so this step provides information to the
job candidate who are
interested in exploring self-employment
and pretty much orientation assist job
candidates to determine if
self-employment
is an appropriate goal and help to
clarify expectations
for small business development an
overview
of the self-employment process
explanation of micro enterprise and the
full program
and going over paperwork so orientation
is available
also to the department of the blind job
candidates prior to
opening a case file with ivo rehab this
assures the iowa department
of the blind job candidates to fully
understand
the self-employment program and are able
to
make an informed choice on whether to
proceed with services
so job candidates who are recipients of
ssdi
or ssi should be referred for benefits
planning
and then also a form called a small
business right for you should be
utilized as a counseling tool
and completed with the job candidate
then we have
a income offset form that's completed
once the results are back
ibrs staff should review these with the
job candidate
if there is amount owed then we will
have to discuss how a
payment plan may be set up to repay
amounts owed
also the iowa self-employment rehab
assistant
will contact the job candidate to
provide the step two paperwork
and schedule the orientation counselors
are
expected to assist the job candidate in
the completion of the step two paperwork
prior to the schedule orientation
appointment
and also iowa department of the blind
job candidates will not be required to
submit
paperwork or open an hour book rehab
service case file
prior to the schedule orientation after
attending the orientation the iowa
department of the blind job candidate
and iowa department of the blind
counselor will determine
when it is an appropriate time to
pursue self-employment and at that time
the file with i will
vote rehab may be open and all necessary
paperwork completed
so timely and consistent communication
with iowa department of the blind
and our business development specialist
is necessary in order to coordinate
services and ensure
progress continues so once when
orientation is completed
the candidate will turn in the paperwork
and then i will review and make sure we
have everything filled out correctly
signed and dated
and i will forward that paperwork to our
business development specialist and
schedule
a calendar to meet with them to review
and go over
their business plan and business
next slide and i think that should be
coshell
yes it is me so after linda meets with
the orientation piece and make sure all
the paperwork is put together she
forwards it to the business service
business development specialist
that we go over with the client and the
counselor
we look at the paperwork to ensure that
there's no questions
or that the candidate feels comfortable
moving forward as part of that team
meeting
in the review of the program we look at
what does the candidate want to
accomplish with their self-employment
goal and what are the feasibilities
pieces of that so we do research we talk
about what's being offered in the
community that they're wanting to serve
we look at is it a virtual based
business where
they can go pretty much anywhere and
what does that look like
we also discuss financial needs
of the business and what do they need to
start this business
those are really tough conversations
sometimes because the person
just wants a job wants to be employed
wants to earn money all those things
and if they don't have the financial
means to do the self-employment piece
where can we go with that how can we
make it work
we really look at how the community
grants can help or assist
or bring in some money for the candidate
to be successful or do we need to make
it a smaller
goal of startup and then budget
forward with the income from the
business so those next steps
are critical too is that we really want
the um candidate to own the process
we don't want to drive the car for them
so to speak
we want them to drive but they we want
them to know that they have backup
they have an extra navigation system so
to speak
that we can help guide them in the steps
that they need to do
one of those steps is benefits planning
if they're receiving the social security
or ssdi
how does that look for them and where do
we go with it
so susie on the next slide is going to
explain what we look for in benefits
planning
hi my name is susie paulson and i'm a
benefits planner at iowa vocational
rehabilitation
and at iowa vocational rehabilitation we
start benefits planning at intake by
having the social security job candidate
sign releases so that we can request
their benefits record
the analysis of that social security
record helps us provide
preliminary information for the job
candidate so that they're equipped with
the knowledge
that they need to make an informed
employment choice
the lack of understanding on how working
will affect a person's social security
disability benefit
causes job candidates to limit their
income
to safe which usually means staying poor
once the job candidate has a job offer
we provide a more detailed benefits
analysis
that's very essential to follow up on
the story of daniel and how benefits
planning is helping him reach his goal
i want to talk a little bit about one
work incentive called a plan to achieve
self-support or pass
it's a work incentive that allows a
social security
recipient to leverage extra money from
social
security to help them reach their
employment goal
daniel receives a full ssi cash benefit
with no reductions because his business
up to this point has not had any net
earnings from self-employment
but all that is changing and he's
increasing his business
every day there are still so many things
that he needs to buy to keep his
business viable so we are starting to
work on a pass for him
and we want to have it in place so that
that
excess income and resources can get get
set aside
he'll still continue to get that full
ssi cash benefit
but he'll have that extra money that he
leverages to use
to buy the things that he needs in order
to qualify for a pass a job candidate
must have a reasonable and reachable
employment goal
be already on ssi or able to qualify for
ssi
the job candidate also needs to have
something that's reducing their ssi
benefit either
earned or unearned income with
self-employment it's important to do a
benefits overview as the candidate is
working on their business plan
as the business progresses and starts to
have net earnings
other work incentives may come into play
so i try to stay
in touch and the team knows to include
me
when those times come it can be tricky
at times and it requires planning and
predicting
when they begin to get countable
earnings that might affect their social
security cash benefit
when the job candidates able to plan
ahead it makes a huge difference in
their willingness to lose their
dependence on their social security
disability benefits
uh next slide please
during that time after we look at the
benefits planning
if they're ssi recipient then we move
forward to business
planning and feasibility and basically
this encompasses
is it going to make marketable sense is
it going to make personal sense
business sense or financial we cover all
those during the planning phase
and it's a comprehensive plan it's not
just one piece taken at one time
it's all interlocking and it makes
sense for each one to go forward with it
so if personal sense doesn't make sense
the market business and financial won't
make sense either
so we have to make sure that we answer
all these questions along with the
candidate really owning
those pieces along the way if they
decide that it makes personal sense
but the business piece they're unsure of
of
how to run a business then we put other
supports in place we look at
do they need help with accounting do
they need help with
an attorney setting up an llc those are
specialized services
that even though business development
specialists are here to answer a lot of
those technical questions
sometimes we're not the experts in those
kind of fields of
law accounting
we're not cpas and we want them to get
the best
assistance that they can or advice in
order to move forward
then we incorporate those financial if
they have enough money to
start the business or saved up or they
have resources to obtain them
we will go forward with it as long as
they
don't cause detriment to their own
personal finances
without reasonable cause every business
is a chance to take
to start there is a you know a success
factor there's a
failure factor that we all have to take
into consideration
but as long as we build that foundation
in this phase of the business
research and feasibility phase that
foundation
should stay strong for them to build the
rest of the business to move forward
we're going to move on to the next slide
those additional resources that we've
been alluding to and talking to
or peppering throughout this whole
conversation so far
there's internal iowa vocational
rehabilitation services
resources there's benefits planning we
also use assistive technology
we have some at experts on staff that
help us
with figuring out is is the computer
system
that the candidate needs for um graphic
design
is it going to work well enough we also
look at
what other assistive technology pieces
will make it easier for them to work
do we need to accommodate their
individual needs
and just buying something off the shelf
isn't going to fit those needs so we
bring in those at people
external resources could look like
score small business development centers
sba easter seals farm programs or other
local community programs or resources
available based on the area that they
live
funding sources we look at banks
sba loans iowa targeted small business
and then the iowa micro loan program and
the iowa able programs
those are all funding sources that have
a commitment
based on credibility within their credit
scores
and ability to pay back some of those
loans but some of those loans are
forgivable
too if they make the required commitment
also we have found too with some of the
iowa
targeted small business there are
funding sources that are grants
that we hadn't been able to find
previously
savings programs we have iable which is
an
able account that helps qualified
individuals that receive ssi
build assets without risking their
benefits as they build up their income
which is important too and that's all
part of the benefits planning
we can move to the next slide
part of the implementation we've done
all the research
we've determined that it's a feasible
plan the candidate has
everything all the tools that they need
to start and they have
all the community resources that they
feel comfortable with
so we look at approvals and funding and
continued assistance
and what does that look like and we
break that up as a team between the
counselor
the business development specialist and
the candidate
area office supervisors get involved too
to ensure that everybody is on board and
everybody's on the same page moving
forward because that communication piece
is
essential for success so we make sure we
all share
where we're at with everything there are
team meetings
relentlessly sometimes to make sure that
the communication is all on the same
level
but we look at the funding sources
how is that done the recommendations
that are needed from me or the counselor
and any modifications that the candidate
feels like they need to do
if we could go to the next slide
and linda will talk about our financial
and technical assistances yes so
financial and technical assistance the
financial
assistance relates to money used to
purchase
the necessary tools and equipment
products or services
to open the doors of the business and
maintain the business as outlined in the
job candidate's business plan
so financial assistance is only
authorized if the business
has a need for funds in order to be
successful and the
individual can provide or demonstrate a
dollar for dollar
match of the funds requested so the
following is guidance on business assets
that may be considered for match
um job candidate will provide a list of
items
the date of the items were purchased an
amount paid for
as well as an estimate of the fair
market value
so the total amount of fees for
certifications or business training
paid by the job candidate would be
considered matched
as long as they were to enhance the job
candidates ability to
conduct the business and also the
documentation would include
a list of trainings which includes the
type of training
as well as the vendor date and amount
paid
also startup cash and savings or
checking account
cash from a loan source like i will able
or a cash grant
would be counted as match so the
financial assistance funds may be
awarded up to ten thousand dollars
based upon an approved business plan and
the job candidates dollar-for-dollar
match
on the amount of funding needed um the
amount recommended
by the business development specialist
and approved by the counselor and
supervisor will be provided as described
above as in support of the business
operations
and then as for technical assistance is
any specific business related services
provided by the business development
specialist
or outside contractor consultant
funded by the iowa self-employment
technical assistance
it may include consulting in the areas
of
marketing or business needs that that
require
certification and licensure to perform
job candidate can request
recommendations for
qualified professionals or may recommend
a provider
themselves so the selected professionals
will be responsibility of the job
candidate and approved by
business development specialist and the
counselor so the award can be up to ten
thousand dollars based on business needs
and the examples
of technical assistance would be if
needing help with
website graphic designs or attorney type
things or accounting
next slide please
so at this point we've done all the
planning we've determined that we're
going to move forward we've determined
that there's financial and technical
assistance going to be awarded to the
candidate
to move forward but part of that process
too is the progress reports
as we move forward with the
implementation of the business
so every month we require candidates to
report to us
on a financial disclosure of
making sure that they have
um they're earning money if they're
losing money
why are they losing money or if they're
not having enough cash flow
what is going on and we have those
discussions in those team meetings again
it comes back to communication
and assuring them that they have the
supports to move forward
in those monthly reports we look at
a future date for stabilization so that
we can move them towards a successful
closure date those dates are really
moving
um some clients are six months out some
clients are 18 months out it's again
it's on an individualized basis
we don't write it into the plan that six
months were done helping them and then
we're going to move them to
case closure and wish them walk on their
business that doesn't happen with the
iowa self-employment program
we are with them from start to whenever
if it's two years out then
and the case closed and they still need
help we're still there
we also look at in the consideration um
a final report given to the candidate
and what does that look like in helping
them understand
that all the community resources so when
we
close a candidate successfully we
ensure that they have all those pieces
there
in order to ensure successful
ongoing supports that they have
at their disclosure also
the business development specialist will
continue
to communicate with the candidate
again indefinitely some candidates like
us to rep
you know communicate on a weekly basis
for a little while till they feel
comfortable
i've had some wanted some daily reports
so that they could feel they had those
supports and wanted to ensure that they
didn't go anywhere
and then eventually they got to a month
two months quarterly biannually
or annually it's up to them as to how
they use that
continued support on the progress
side of it the counselor discusses any
of the case closure
with the candidate on the ib or iowa
vocational
rehabilitation side of it so that way
they take care of the initiatives
and again it's a team we we help
candidate as a team
and that just solidifies how that looks
for for the candidate
we could go to the next slide
the monthly
the follow up with it um is a timeline
that i just alluded to before again
it's it can be six months it can be a
quarterly
bi-annually or annually but the timeline
again
is sometimes we may set it for quarterly
but we may move it back to monthly
because there's something going on in
the market
where the business isn't doing as well
as it once was or maybe the candidate
needs
to hire somebody and we need to help
them figure out those human resource
pieces because usually small business
entrepreneurs
don't hire very many people and don't
really know how to hire
um or they just need some temporary help
and how do we help them
again that the assistance
is really there for them and we can't
you know reiterate that in this
conversation as to how
those are available to them and again
they're as needed
they're not something that um we set a
hard timeline on in any of our
policies or procedures it's an
individualized service
that we give to each of our candidates
next slide
and then i'm going to turn it over to
steve
to talk about transition in iowa
self-employment
okay well okay this is um actually one
of my favorite topics
and as you might recall under the
workforce innovation and opportunities
act
wioa a good deal of our effort
is directed towards those high school
students who have barriers who have
disability related barriers
and i mentioned to you that about 23 000
of them exist here in the state of iowa
and many of those maybe upwards of
eight nine thousand of them are already
active clients with us
the other ones were providing uh
services to them as well but for all of
them that we're aware of for all of the
students
we're obliged to provide some kind of
work
awareness and uh pre-employment
transition services and it can include
all kinds of things that
everything from financial literacy to
self-advocacy to
actual work skills training or you know
all of those different kinds of things
where
where young people are actually getting
to taste the world of work and find out
what those local career pathways
are like out there in the community now
all of uh 99 counties in iowa have
schools
high schools and they all have their
different approach to how they go about
career awareness
but i think what i have noticed in the
state of iowa
there hasn't been an awful lot of
attention given to entrepreneurship at
the high school level
so we at ivrs are flying our flag high
and we
we're going out and as we help to
educate people on local career pathways
we also include
information about entrepreneurship and
what that could look like
i want to remind you that one of our
famous presidents
dwight eisenhower at the age of 10 in
the year 1900
his mama gave him some ground and some
seeds
and said you can plant anything you want
there
but whatever you sell you get to keep
that money for yourself now this man was
10 years old
and you wouldn't expect you'd know
anything about entrepreneurship
but what he did was he went around
abilene
kansas any any any canvas the whole
place
and he asked people what they would like
to eat if he were to grow that
and he and he got a list so he went home
and he planted all of those things and
then at the end of the year he harvested
it all
and went around with his wagon and sold
off everything he had and he had enough
money to buy himself
shoes and shotgun shells and all kinds
of stuff
that's entrepreneurship at a young level
but you see uh folks who are in their
their high school ages or even younger
they can begin learning those concepts
and they're good concepts for them to
to understand what does it take to earn
money in this world
what does it take to maybe start a
business
and you realize too that we live in a
very rural state here in iowa
there's lots of people out there you
know 50 miles from anywhere there's corn
fields around them
what are they going to do for a living
when they grow up there's not
necessarily a factory there
but a lot of them have really really
great skills that they can market
out there to our agriculture industry
that occurs here in iowa
or in our cities of course there's the
the typical trade type things or
it could be just about anything opening
restaurants it could be
welding it could be contract workers
whatever that might be
but we tried to start that in the high
school age and we've got a lot of
different interesting ways of doing it
uh koshell and dennis have worked
together with our
with our transition resource managers to
come up with
very interactive games or very
interactive
oh i don't know maybe maybe
meetings where people get together and
actually
try entrepreneurial things one of the
things i'm thinking of is one of our
summer programs we had down in the
city of ames a few years ago and we had
a bunch of high school kids that didn't
have any business background at all
but they spent a week with us at a
community college
and they basically put they learned all
about entrepreneurship
one of our business development
specialists taught them every day a
little bit about that
they learned about business planning
they learned a little bit about
marketing and all of those things
and then at the end of the day groups of
them would put together a business plan
and by the end of the week they all had
their business plan and they had to
defend it in front of a shark tank and i
got to be
one of the sharks and so i got to listen
to all these presentations
and you cannot believe the excitement
that these students seem to have
at the beginning of the week they were
yawning and not paying any attention by
the end of the week they were up there
given
wonderful presentations about their
businesses of course it was all
you know fake businesses but they they
gave wonderful presentations they had
the
the skills kind of learned and it was
fun for them to do it
and it just adds one more thing to that
list of possibilities
of that that transition age students
can acquire as they begin to look
forward to what am i going to do when i
get out of high school
and and then for those who have
disabilities
how am i going to get that done what
kind of supports will i need what kind
of backing am i going to need
what kind of training am i going to need
and all of that can begin
young and we have found in the state of
iowa that whether we're talking small
business or
employment in the community
it really it really goes so much better
when you begin
young by the time they get out of high
school they ought to have a pretty good
idea which
direction they're heading so that's
that's my spiel on uh on transition and
we're very proud of that
if we could go to the next slide
part of self self-employment and
transition
is working with candidates like steve
just explained and
one candidate we have that's going
through the program currently
is faith um susie
has worked with faith from the very
beginning i just recently
picked up with her but faith is a dual
client between the iowa department for
the blind
and i will vocational rehabilitation
through our tap
services in the schools now there's a
lot of team members involved here when
it
comes to getting a team meeting put
together
it really is an act of huge proportions
because everybody has busy schedules but
faith has actively taken it
into her own hands with her natural
supports aka
mom and moved forward with her
um goal of selling shirts and bags
and really being out in the community um
susie do you want to take over here and
kind of explain where
you came in with will and faith and
benefits planning uh
yeah the self-employment isn't usually
an option that
is on the radar for most uh parents that
have a child with the
barriers to employment but faith is a
really good example
of you know family support and
engagement with her community she lives
in a small town in iowa and everybody
knows her she's part of a large family
and that is a critical piece for success
in self-employment
faith is still in high school she's 19
years old she has one more year
and she she's barely started but she's
already generating
income from her business she designs and
creates t-shirts
bags pajamas and other things using a
machine that cuts
vinyl forms she's being
assisted in this by her family and by a
job developer she just has an incredible
amount of support and word of her
business is growing very fast
currently we're in the process of
writing a pass
plan for her to provide additional funds
to help with the purchase of the
building that's going to be called face
fashion shack
thank you susie and i should give a huge
handout to susie because i really
threw a lot of stuff at her today um
she's our benefits resource
manager she helps me tremendously
understand the benefits
that social security really puts
holds on what people can do with their
income while they're receiving those
resources and been susie's always able
to explain those to me
um if we could go to the next slide
and i'm going to turn it back over to
steve um regarding the self-employment
advisory committee
and what his vision what that is well as
you might
uh you might surmise as you're as you're
looking at all of this
our self-employment programs are kind of
complex
there's there's a lot to these and
how in the world can we help to make the
information that we're trying to share
with individuals who have disabilities
or even our field staff who don't do
this every day
how do we get this digestible how do we
get this in a real meaningful way for
them they can actually make use of it
and not be afraid of it and
turn around and run the other direction
so one of the things that we've come up
with here in iowa
we've put together an advisory committee
and it's made up of field staff
individuals mostly rehabilitation
counselors who work in the field
who have an interest in self-employment
who have worked with the self-employment
program for a while
and we meet on a quarterly basis and we
basically review processes
and forms and things that
the field counselors are having trouble
with out there in the field
uh something that needs attention uh we
don't understand how to do this or that
or
we're getting in trouble with our
financial section because we're
we're not following our our purchasing
principles right and so we need to kind
of factor that into what we're doing or
i've heard from a lot of clients that we
we don't understand this
it's scary it's too much for us all of
these different things and they're there
to help
our core team which would be dennis and
linda
and coachelle and me and susie to uh
to hear from people that are actually
using this program what would make it
better
not necessarily make it easier but
basically make it more digestible and
more meaningful for people
so that it's actually something that
they can they can interact in and find
it helpful and and and feel like they
are making progress
and this group has helped us already in
uh in our process to maybe take our
our policies and try to maybe
streamline them provide some training
out in the field for them
to look at our forums to make them less
intimidating um
and to know where we want to maybe
change course a little bit and provide a
little bit more in the way of individual
supports
but it's uh it's a fairly new thing we
just started it this year
we're already going through our our
process and our forums and
trying to make this thing so that it's
not uh not quite so intimidating and yet
at the same time
we still get that quality that we're
looking for
okay linda do you want to talk about
virtual services real quick
and the next one yes yes yes
so with um virtual services
um it has not slowed us down a bit it's
actually a good thing because we have
been
very busy so far this year um job
candidates are
telling me ever since covet they
actually have time to sit down and think
about
um starting a business or if they have
an existing one they're thinking about
starting it back up again so it has
given them a lot of time to think about
how to go about their business and
orientations are
set up by zoom or google hangouts and
that's working out well and then of
course with technology
you know there's a few pickups here and
there but we are always
um able to continue on with the phone
meeting
or if needed if we are if they are
wanting to
meet in person at the des moines office
i am i'm happy
to to meet them there to to do it in
person so
um with the changes and everything
virtual has been working out well
and then next slide as um iowa iowans
gainfully self-employed
statistics um for the five-year averages
you know referrals are about 89 closures
35 and active cases is 125
and as of right now our current year
statistics we go by the
federal physical year between july 1st
uh 2020 through june 30th of 2021
and as of right now our referrals are at
20. we have
12 closures so far and then that will
continue growing
as you know we still have time up to
july 1st
to get more closures and our active
cases
is at 202 right now
if we could go to the next slide um we
have
showcased on this presentation for
entrepreneurs
that we have successfully helped the
first one
is stacy tajan she's a she lives in
wyoming iowa
she's a cattle breeder she's a fifth
generation
farmer um and by fifth generation
she counts her brother because she has
to share the title
so she's older than him or he's older
than her so
he's fourth she's fifth that's her big
joke but she
um took these pictures for us of her
cattle that she has successfully
bred and raised and these are all sold
now within her community and she
really is integrated into the community
4-h
farmers groups and other
breeders across the country to obtain
um what she needs to be successful
but go to the next one
bob farmer is a gunsmith out of anthon
iowa
he owns the shooting shop um the kind of
the cool part about bob is he had a
life-changing event
he lost his vision when he was 47 years
old
and had been a purchasing agent for over
20 years for a company and
when he lost that job he didn't know
what he wanted to do but he'd always had
a great desire to be a gunsmith and that
is what he's managed to
accomplish through the help of iowa
department for the blind
i iowa vocational rehabilitation
services in isc
his business opened in 2010 and is still
running
successfully you can go to the next one
jared o'reer um he's a young man
father of two a very newborn he's very
proud of but he's out of waterloo
iowa he wanted me to say that by the way
he runs a landscaping business and a
small little handyman
um in the last six months since he
started his business
he has grossed over 32 000
um don't he has to take expenses away
from that
but six months into the job engrossing
that kind of money with dedication
being a new father is amazing and
and when i first met him he was very
soft-spoken
now i can't get a word in edgewise and
if anybody
in this call like my co-workers know me
i talk a lot
so therefore they um it's really cool to
work with jared and his accomplishments
last one austin spahn was a high school
student
he started as a hobby learning and
cleaning
businesses he decided that he was going
to make this his career
he worked part-time at a grocery store
went to high school
hired some people out of his high school
class to clean businesses
and do other things in the community so
that he could save
money to buy a cleaning business that he
knew somebody was going to retire in
soon he purchased that business in 2014
he now employs over seven employees
and he has increased his business
steadily each year
so he is um pretty proud of himself he's
a young entrepreneur that really knew
what he wanted and figured out how to do
it and
used our help to do it last
slide and i realized we're over in time
but if anybody has any questions that
haven't been answered yet please let
us know and we'd be glad to answer them
well thank you so much team iowa i am
going to
turn off the slides the slides will be
made available to
our attendees today and i have a few
quick questions that i know i want to
quickly ask
so i'm really curious you know most of
all
kind of to go back to that virtual
services piece you know how have you
really capitalized on using virtual
services
um to you know reach more clients how
have you structured
um you know your programs um and how
how has that been different now um than
before hey i want to jump in here this
is steve faulkner
and i got to tell you something we we
we didn't really believe in virtual
services much but we were having our
business development specialists as i as
i told you each one covers half of our
state
they were just running all over the
place trying to keep up with uh
meetings with uh with our job candidates
out in the field
and um that was a lot of travel time and
even before covet started we started
kind of slipping into having
zoom meetings because it just made it
easier for us to handle that
so when covet came along and then
everybody about eighty percent of our
staff wound up working virtually
we were making a lot of use out of zoom
we're really finding out that that
really expands our capacity more than
anything
now there are some individuals where
zoom doesn't work very well
some of our blind candidates really
still prefer to be
meeting in person and and that personal
contact is still
important and so we we can do that here
in iowa
we're massed up and we social distance
but most of our meetings now and even
like this meeting most of our meetings
are virtual
and it works out very very well for
folks like cochell and dennis and linda
they don't run themselves to death and
at the same time
remember we've got 99 counties and all
of them have high schools and
if we're going to visit any of them high
schools we can do it by zoom and we
could visit two or three in the same day
and still be able to uh get off work at
4 30. so
yeah there's there's been a lot of real
advantages to it and clients seem to
really enjoy it too
i might jump in there too philip one of
the uh
cool things that have kind of developed
with the virtual
service delivery onset is related to
susie
you know you heard suzy talk a little
bit about the role of benefits planning
as it relates to self-employment but
she's been able and this is just an
example
of the power of virtual services but
she's been able to connect to
parent and family groups so there's
always tons of questions about
benefits planning and how it impacts you
know our loved ones and family members
and she's gone out and reached out to
families and now has
connected to uh developed a wednesday or
thursday evening
uh parent group that ranges anywhere
from 11
parents to 70 parents depending upon the
topics
and she connects virtually through zoom
for parents all across the state
but that's just one example of of
what's occurring in a variety of
different services
um so i want to ask the question so you
know we have a lot of folks from state
agencies we have lots of provider folks
on our call today
um so why would so my question for iowa
for your the team
here is if you were going to start from
the very beginning you're just going to
get started and start adding
entrepreneurship to the portfolio of
services or efforts that you were
doing to support your clients with
disabilities where would you start and
what would you do first
i think one of the ongoing struggles
that we have
is to continue to be able to educate our
field staff
on the power and value of
self-employment
and and it's not kind of a traditional
way to think about employment
so that education and training is
something that we're always revisiting
so i think i think the first step would
be to sell the
value of self-employment and the
entrepreneurship and and get people to
believe that
we're not stuck in this traditional mode
of employment
and with some flexibility and innovation
and creativity
uh the world is open to people's skills
and we have the ability to customize
that
that would that would be my first
reaction i'm kind of curious to hear
koshel who's on the front lines of
dealing with self-employment how she
would respond
i'll put her on the spot thanks dave
um one of the biggest things with
looking at
the field staff and helping them realize
the potential of self-employment
is really talking to them about clients
that we have helped
gain employment through self-employment
and
creating that cohesive team
of we're here to support we're here for
a resource so if they have
questions regarding a client that came
in
and wanted to do self-employment they're
like oh we don't know anything about
that but we know that
abc companies hiring it's not pulling
them to a traditional employment goal
because
that candidate obviously has concerns so
they're looking for us for resources so
it's having that open communication line
knowing that the counselors that i serve
on my side of the state and i think
dennis can say the same thing too on his
side
we have that open door and that open
doors
they can call us at any time and ask us
or a role model or
play with the what-if scenarios with us
so that they feel comfortable talking to
that client
and initiating the self-employment
process knowing
that you know it may not be a great idea
but if we have that conversation
the candidate or the client can own it
in the end
as to whether they go forward with or
not and it's not us just saying
no or yes it's it's a team
decision you know philip too i tend to
think that sometimes we make it too
complex and that there's some common
sense involved with
helping somebody look at their skills
and abilities and figuring out well can
you
bring in more money than you're spending
but with that said
um koshel and dennis and linda bring
special
knowledge and background on zoning and
legal and and
entrepreneurial self-employment things
that really do
make a difference and are critical to
somebody's long-term success
so having a foundation of somebody
that's familiar
with self-employment and running a
business and how that impacts the
the local community is is also very
important so even though i tend to
try to increase capacity saying well
everybody can be doing this
the role of our business development
specialist and the expertise they bring
to specifically look at those cases from
a business function
is really important and i don't i want
to be able to make sure that gets across
there
wonderful thank you um steve steve
faulkner did you have
something you wanted to add well i was
just going to add to that and suggest
too that
our client still has to be number one
and what we're doing is we're trying to
we're trying to find ways not only not
to say no
but to open up possibilities and we have
to open our own mind sometimes to that
that case that you saw with the fire
starters that that took some real
thinking outside of the box because this
man is going to need to have some
coaching going on
you know 10 years ago we looked at that
we would have said forget it we can't do
that because you won't have ongoing
supports
but now looking at it from a different
lens and saying you know this is
something that could be a possibility
this could really take off business is a
very complicated thing and i think a lot
of times we have a tendency like david
said to make it
more complex really than it needs to be
but we do have to have the right
supports
and we do have to involve all the
resources
and the rehabilitation science to go
with it this is not just
business planning now this is actually
working with people who have
disabilities
to try to find out what kind of
accommodations or what kind of special
adaptations that they're going to need
to make it work it's not so much um are
we going to make it work but how are we
going to make it work
wonderful thank you and the last um i
was going to say i know that koshel
and david were very active in the q a
box answering some of our audience
questions
um thank you very much for that um
one last question i do want to take is
um the issue of kind of diversity when
it comes to entrepreneurs
um obviously you know io is a small
state um when you look at you know
a lot of the factors um related to you
know the
successful entrepreneurs you know
oftentimes entrepreneurs who
entrepreneurs with or without
disabilities are older they're male um
they're white
um but you know i i personally believe
that anybody can be an entrepreneur if
they really
stick to it and so i'm curious what can
you do to engage more people of color
with
disabilities or more women with
disabilities in entrepreneurship as a
pathway
into the workforce
that's a great question i i think you
know this is an area that we struggle a
little bit with
as an agency and uh about
three months ago our agency took a step
to
create a cultural diversity committee
and
and that committee is made up of
individuals across the state that have
interest and passion in this topic and
we've tasked that group with really
two major goals one is to look at
our job candidate outreach and how we
interact
with job candidates of diverse
backgrounds and are we serving
uh a representation of the local
community
you know that what what is if that
community is made up of a certain makeup
do we see something similar to that
in our caseload and once we get those
